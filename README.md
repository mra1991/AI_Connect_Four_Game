# AI_Connect_Four_Game
This project is a C++ console application that allows players to play Connect Four against a computer AI. 
The AI utilizes a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make intelligent moves. 
To cope with the game's large number of possible configurations, the AI has a horizon that determines the number of moves it can see ahead. 
The AI always chooses the best possible move within its horizon, providing a challenging opponent for the player.
